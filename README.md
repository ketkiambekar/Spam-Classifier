# SMS Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes

In this program, we implement a spam classifier using a very common generative algorithm called Naive Bayes. Inspite of assuming that word occurences are independent of each other (hence the moniker "Naive"), we get a surprisingly good accuracy of 98% with this classifier. This program has been implemented without the use of sci-kit learn library.
